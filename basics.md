# Conditional statements and loops
1. Write a program that reads from the console three numbers of type int and prints their sum. 

2. Write a program that reads from the console the radius "r" of a circle and prints its perimeter and area.

3. Write a program that reads from the console two integer numbers (int) and prints how many numbers between them exist, such that the remainder of their division by 5 is 0. 

Example: in the range (14, 25) there are 3 such numbers: 15, 20 and 25.

Write a program that reads two numbers from the console and prints the greater of them. Solve the problem without using conditional statements.
